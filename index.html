          <h3>🍆 It began as a bachelor party</h3>
          <p>We rented an RV.</p>
          <p>We pointed its nose east.</p>
          <p>We drove.</p>
          <p>We saw the <strong>world's largest Yo-Yo</strong> and a statue of Kevin Costner carved out of a single log.</p>
          <p>It was wonderful.</p>
          <p>The next year, we had no bachelor party to plan. Then we realized we didn't need an excuse for an awesome roadtrip with friends!</p>
          <p>The annual RV trip was born.</p>

          <h3>🚌 This year we're going bigger</h3>
          <p>Every year we discuss how to make the RV Trip even more fun. This year our big experiment is <strong>multiple RVs.</strong></p>
          <p>Before, attendance was limited by the number of people we could legally cram into an RV. This year, we’re opening up the headcount for everyone who wants to join the adventure.</p>
          <p><strong>We'll rent as many RVs as we need.</strong></p>

          <h2>Join Us</h2>
          <p>The nature of the RV Trip makes it hard to give a lot of specifics about what we'll be doing. A big part of the fun is to only have some basic ideas of what to do, and even those only get half done. There are some constants though:</p>
          <h3>🎈 What You Can Expect</h3>
          <p>Best put, <strong>it's a 5-day party bus.</strong></p>
          <p>We drink, we play games, we stop at crazy places, we gamble in casinos, we eat at <strong>questionable highway restaurants</strong>, we swim in strange lakes.</p>
          <p>This year, we are pointing the caravan in the general direction of <strong>Bend, OR</strong>. We're going to punch up to the Bend area the first night, and then spend the rest of the days exploring all sorts of places in that part of the state.</p>

          <h3>💰 What It Costs</h3>
          <p>On average, past RV Trips have cost about $600 per person for <em>everything</em>. This includes all food for 5 days, the RV rental, gas, activities, etc etc.</p>
          <p>This year, we're requiring everyone to kick in a non-refundable deposit of $200. This is to ensure we are getting an accurate headcount of attendees so we can plan logistics, rent RVs well in advance, etc.</p>

          <p><a href="https://www.paypal.me/mginsburg/200">Send the deposit to Greg.</a> Deposits will be tracked in the group Splitwise along with all other RV Trip expneses so we can easily settle up after the trip is over.</p>

          <h3>📅 When</h3>
          <p>We leave on October 4th and return late on October 8th. You'll need Wed-Fri off work.</p>
